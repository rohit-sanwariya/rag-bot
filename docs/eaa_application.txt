EAA can be used to provide secure access to different types of applications used by your organization.

First, you would need an account in Control Center and administrator rights. If you don't have an account yet, contact your sales representative. With this, you can log in to Enterprise Center from ​Akamai Control Center​. After you finish this easy set up, you can immediately start-off with Get started with Bookmark Application.

To configure a more real-world practical application, you would need at least one instance of a connector as a virtual machine (VM) in your environment. You can learn this in Get started with Web Application along with configuring a HTTPS application.

Lastly, if you plan securely access a client-access application on an end-user's laptop, you would need to additionally set up and configure the EAA Client software on the end-user's laptop top, create a TCP-type client access application, create access-control lists (ACLs) and apply device posture policies to access your TCP-type client access application. You can learn this in Get started with TCP-type client-access Application

To use a simple-to-complex learning approach, start with the Get started with Bookmark Application, then learn the Get started with Web Application, and finally do the Get started with TCP-type client-access Application.

Get started with a web application
Suggest Edits
Web applications are used by an enterprise and reside in the app server within the data center.

To provide secure access with Enterprise Application Access (EAA), attach an access and identity connector to the web application server inside the data center. The connector does a dialout to the Enterprise Application Access Cloud on port 443. The users connect to the Enterprise Application Access Login Portal URL in their web browsers. They provide their credentials once to gain access to all of the applications.

Get started with a web app

Set up a web application and learn how to:

Create and install a connector in Amazon AWS environment.

Add users to the Enterprise Application Access Cloud directory, create an ​Akamai​ identity provider (IdP).

Associate the directory and deploy the IdP.

Configure a web application (HTTPS application) with time-based access control rules (ACL) for restricted access to certain users at specific times.

Add authentication with the identity provider (IdP) for the web application.

Verify if the user can access the web application using the external hostname.

Start with a simple configuration:

Use the cloud directory in Enterprise Application Access (do not use any other Active Directory or LDAP).

Use the ​Akamai​ cloud domain (do not use any custom external domain). You do not have to configure and upload certificates.

Also, we skip for now application services like URL rewrite rules for optimized content delivery, URL path-based policies, and use of Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) for offload-processing of internet-based content by dedicated servers.

The authentication mechanism for the web application server is set to none (default). Additional configuration is needed if you want to use any of the advanced application-facing authentication mechanisms like SAML 2.0, WS Federation, and OpenID Connect 1.0.

Get started with a TCP-type client-access application
Suggest Edits
If you want to secure access to a single TCP application with a single hostname, you can use a TCP-type client-access application. This type of application, such as Microsoft Outlook, is created for a single TCP application (perApp) and supports TCP only. All TCP-type client-access applications are fully backward compatible with the latest Enterprise Application Access Cloud.

TCP-type client-access app lets you set up access control rules or services like the Enterprise Application Access solution used for secure access for HTTP applications.

Get started with a TCP-type app

For each application (1), a WebSocket tunnel is created, and the traffic is directed to the Enterprise Application Access Cloud (2). Unlike a VPN, this tunnel does not provide access to the entire network. It only establishes connectivity to the authorized application. From the Enterprise Application Access Cloud, traffic is directed to the connector through the firewall (3). Traffic is then forwarded to the application server (4). For example, if you configure the Outlook client as a client-access application, this traffic is directed to the Microsoft Exchange server.

With this workflow, a single TCP application is secured by Enterprise Application Access. Users are able to access the application with the configured internal host. If there are multiple desktop applications, then multiple TCP client applications need to be configured.

Set up a TCP-type client-access application and learn how to:

Create and install a connector in the Amazon AWS environment.

Add users to the Enterprise Application Access Cloud directory.

Create an ​Akamai​ identity provider (IdP) with EAA Client and Device Posture settings enabled.

Associate the directory and deploy the IdP.

Configure a TCP-type client-access application with Device Posture risk tiers and tags as ACLs. With tiers and tags, you can restrict users that try to access the TCP-type app on risky or compromised devices.

Add authentication with the IdP for the TCP-type application.

Verify that a user can access the TCP-type application using the external hostname.

Depending on the user's operating system you need to:

Set up EAA Client

Configure EAA Client

Create UDP and TCP applications.

Start with a simple configuration:

Use the cloud directory in Enterprise Application Access (do not use any other Active Directory or LDAP).

Use the ​Akamai​ cloud domain (do not use any custom external domain). You do not have to configure and upload certificates.

Create, download and install an Access Identity Connector

Manage role-based access control
Enable role based access control for Enterprise Application Access (EAA) administrators in Identity and Access Management application in ​Akamai Control Center​. When you have an account with ​Akamai​, for each contract, admin and viewer roles are commonly used for controlling Enterprise Application Access (EAA). Other default roles like editor, publisher are not used in Enterprise Application Access. The admin role has read and write access to the EAA application. The viewer role has read access to the EAA application and cannot make configuration updates. Small organizations normally have one user with admin role, to configure the different components of Enterprise Application Access like connectors, applications, directories, identity providers, and applications, and other users as viewers. Large organizations might have multiple contracts to isolate staging environment and production environment, or for isolation between different geographical locations. They might want to have multiple administrators having different privileges for different contracts. Alternatively, even within one contract, an organization might want to have a unique administrator for each component.

With role-based access control, you get a higher level of control and can fine-tune administration management tasks. It can be seamlessly distributed across multiple administrators by the super administrator of the account with role-based access control in ​Akamai Control Center​. You can also customize the control for different components in Enterprise Application Access to different administrators by choosing the proper permission settings in the Identity and Access Management application in ​Akamai Control Center​.

These portal roles are preconfigured for Enterprise Application Access in the Identity and Access Management application in ​Akamai Control Center​ are:

Preconfigured roles	Permission settings	Read or Write privileges
Admin	EAA - Admin	EAA administrator with read and write access to connectors, identity providers (IdP), directories, applications, and reports.
Viewer	EAA - ReadOnly	EAA administrator with read access to connectors, identity providers, directories, applications, and reports.
The different portal roles that can be configured for Enterprise Application Access in the Identity and Access Management application in ​Akamai Control Center​ are:

Configurable roles	Permission settings	Read or Write privileges

In Enter Name type a name for the custom role.

In Enter Description type a description for the custom role.

In Summary enter a list of products.

Select All permissions. Based on the type of access required for the role, the administrator can select one or more of the permissions for controlling Enterprise Application Access:

Admin role	Write and Read access resource type	Ready only access resource type
EAA - App Admin	✓ EAA application	✓ all
EAA - Connector Admin	✓ EAA connector	✓ all
EAA - IdP Admin	✓ EAA identity provider (IdP) and directories	✓ all
EAA - Report Admin	✓ EAA Reports (IdP)	✓ all
Further customization is possible by selecting multiple choices, for example, you can have EAA - App Admin and EAA - Connector Admin set to one administrator, so that your admin has read and write access to application, connector, and read access to identity provider, directory, and EAA reports.

Add a user to a portal role in ​Akamai Control Center​
You can add any user belonging to the account, to do administration of the different resources like applications, connectors, identity providers (IdP) or directories.

Open the application.

In the ​Akamai Control Center​, go to ☰ > ACCOUNT ADMIN > Identity & access.

In the classic Luna UI, on the Configure menu, go to Organization and click Manage Users & Groups.

Select Users and API Clients.

In Group select All Groups.
All the users associated with the account within all groups are shown.

Select the user whose role needs to be modified.

Select Edit roles.
All of the contracts are in the Group name column. All of the roles of this user for each contract are in the Roles column.

Select the contract for which you want to change the privileges for the user.

In Roles click Edit and enter the new role you created and update the role of the user.

Click Save. The user's role for the contract gets updated.

When the user logs into the Enterprise Center for the appropriate contract, based on the permissions set by the account administrator, they are allowed to access that resource.

Example:
There are three contracts for an account. The user user_a@gmail.com has an admin role for contract_1, unassigned roles for contract_2 and contract_3, initially.

If you want to grant read and write access only to the EAA application resource for this user, update a custom role of EAA-App-Admin.

With the updated permissions, when the user logs in with valid credentials, they can make configuration updates in Applications. But when they try to access identity provider, directory, or connectors they get the error message: You are not authorized to perform this operation. Please contact your administrator.
